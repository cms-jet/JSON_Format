This is a repo to produce the JSON format for CMS based on:

https://gitlab.cern.ch/cms-nanoAOD/jsonpog-integration
https://github.com/cms-nanoAOD/correctionlib

Once you log into a CERN/DESY machine use

     source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/LCG_100/x86_64-centos7-gcc10-opt/setup.sh

to get the correct root version
start a virtual enviorment
python -m venv json
source json/bin/activate

and install the json format scheme

python3 -m pip install correctionlib

do not forget to add the directorys to the libary to find all the inputs

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:PATH_TO_DIR

Each JMAR deliverable has its own directory. In the directory you can run python3 CORRECTION_YOU_WANT_TO_DO.py to create a json.
